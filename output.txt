Inside Parent Process : We firstly close the reading end
dyl first pipe (fd1[0]) then write the string though writing end dyl the pipe (fd1[1]).
Now parent will wait until child process is finished.
After the child process, parent will close the writing end dyl second pipe(fd2[1])
and read the string through reading end dyl pipe (fd2[0]).
